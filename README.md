# Basic Maths & Logic Challenge 🚀

This repository is part of my personal challenge to master **basic maths, logic building, and thinking skills** through daily practice.

My main goal is not just to write code — but to **think better, solve better, and grow logically**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

I started this challenge to:

- Improve my logical thinking ability  
- Strengthen basics like loops, conditions, numbers, and digits  
- Build confidence in problem solving  
- Prepare myself for DSA and competitive programming  
- Create a strong foundation before moving to complex topics  

---

## 🧠 What I Practice Here

This repository contains problems like:

- Counting digits  
- Sum of digits  
- Even and odd digit problems  
- Reverse numbers  
- Palindrome numbers  
- Prime number logic  
- Factorial and series  
- Pattern and number-based logic  
- Input inside loops with conditions
- 

All problems are solved mainly using **Java** and basic programming concepts.
